# Lab Answer Key: Module 3: Visualizing Big Data
# Lab: Visualizing data

## Exercise 1: Visualizing data using the ggplot2 package

#### Task 1: Import the flight delay data into a data frame
1. Log in to the **LON-DEV** VM as **Adatum\\AdatumAdmin** with the password **Pa55w.rd**.
2. Start your R development environment of choice (Visual Studio or RStudio), and create a new R file.
3. Add the following statement to the R file and run it to set the working directory:
	```
	setwd("E:\\Labfiles\\Lab03")
	```
4. Add the following statements to the R file and run them to create an XDF data source that references the data file:
	```
	flightDelayDataXdf <- "FlightDelayData.xdf"
	flightDelayData <- RxXdfData(flightDelayDataXdf)
	```
5. Add the following statements to the R file and run them to import the sample data into a data frame:
	```
	rxOptions(reportProgress = 1)
    delayPlotData <- rxImport(flightDelayData, rowsPerRead = 1000000,
    varsToKeep = c("Distance", "Delay", "Origin", "OriginState"),
    rowSelection = (Distance > 0) & as.logical(rbinom(n = .rxNumRows, size = 1, prob = 0.02))
)
	```

#### Task 2: Generate line plots to visualize the delay data
1. Add and run the following statements. This code installs the **tidyverse** package and brings the **tidyverse** library into scope:
	```
    install.packages("tidyverse")
    library(tidyverse)
	```
2. Add and run the following statement. This code creates a scatter plot of flight distance on the x axis against delay time on the y axis:
	```
    ggplot(data = delayPlotData) +
    geom\_point(mapping = aes(x = Distance, y = Delay)) +
    xlab("Distance (miles)") +
    ylab("Delay (minutes)")
	```
3. Add and run the following statement. This code creates a line plot of flight distance on the x axis against delay time on the y axis:
	```
    delayPlotData %>%
    filter(!is.na(Delay) & (Delay >= 0) & (Delay <= 1000)) %>%
    ggplot(mapping = aes(x = Distance, y = Delay)) +
    xlab("Distance (miles)") +
    ylab("Delay (minutes)") +
    geom_point(alpha = 1/50) +
    geom_smooth(color = "red")
	```
4. Add and run the following statement. This code creates a faceted plot organized by departure state:
	```
    delayPlotData %>%
    filter(!is.na(Delay) & (Delay >= 0) & (Delay <= 1000)) %>%
    ggplot(mapping = aes(x = Distance, y = Delay)) +
    xlab("Distance (miles)") +
    ylab("Delay (minutes)") +
    geom_point(alpha = 1/50) +
    geom_smooth(color = "red") +
    theme(axis.text = element_text(size = 6)) +
    facet_wrap( ~ OriginState, nrow = 8)
	```
**Results**: At the end of this exercise, you will have used the **ggplot2** package to generate line plots that depict flight delay times as a function of distance traveled and departure state.

## Exercise 2: Examining relationships in big data using the rxLinePlot function

#### Task 1: Plot delay as a percentage of flight time
1. Add and run the following code. This code creates the XDF file to be used for the graphs:
	```
    delayDataWithProportionsXdf <- "FlightDelayDataWithProportions.xdf"
    delayPlotDataXdf <- rxImport(flightDelayData, outFile = delayDataWithProportionsXdf,
    overwrite = TRUE, append ="none", rowsPerRead = 1000000,
    varsToKeep = c("Distance", "ActualElapsedTime", "Delay", "Origin", "Dest", "OriginState", "DestState", "ArrDelay", "DepDelay", "CarrierDelay", "WeatherDelay", "NASDelay", "SecurityDelay", "LateAircraftDelay"),
    rowSelection = (Distance > 0) & (Delay >= 0) & (Delay <= 1000) & !is.na(ActualElapsedTime) & (ActualElapsedTime > 0),
    transforms = list(DelayPercent = (Delay / ActualElapsedTime) * 100)
	)
	```
2. Add and run the following code. This code creates a cube summarizing the data of interest from the XDF file:
	```
	delayPlotCube <- rxCube(DelayPercent ~ F(Distance):OriginState, data = delayPlotDataXdf,
	rowSelection = (DelayPercent <= 100)
	)
	```
3. Add and run the following statement. This code changes the name of the first column in the cube to **Distance** (it was **F\_Distance**):
	```
	names(delayPlotCube)[1] <- "Distance"
	```
4. Add and run the following statement. This code creates a data frame from the cube:
	```
	delayPlotDF <- rxResultsDF(delayPlotCube)
	```
5. Add and run the following statement. This code uses the **rxLinePlot** function to generate a scatter plot of **DelayPercent** versus **Distance**:
	```
    rxLinePlot(DelayPercent~Distance, data = delayPlotDF, type="p",
    title = "Flight delay as a percentage of flight time against distance",
    xTitle = "Distance (miles)",
    yNumTicks = 10,
    yTitle = "Delay %",
    symbolStyle = ".",
    symbolSize = 2,
    symbolColor = "red",
    scales = (list(x = list(draw = FALSE)))
	)
	```

#### Task 2: Plot regression lines for the delay data
1. Add and run the following statement. This code repeats the previous plot but adds a smoothed line overlay:
	```
    rxLinePlot(DelayPercent~Distance, data = delayPlotDF, type=c("p", "smooth"),
    title = "Flight delay as a percentage of flight time against distance",
    xTitle = "Distance (miles)",
    yNumTicks = 10,
    yTitle = "Delay %",
    symbolStyle = ".",
    symbolSize = 2,
    symbolColor = "red",
    scales = (list(x = list(draw = FALSE)))
    )
	```
2. Add and run the following statement. This code facets the plot by **OriginState**:
	```
    rxLinePlot(DelayPercent~Distance | OriginState, data = delayPlotDF, type="smooth",
    title = "Flight delay as a percentage of flight time against distance, by state",
    xTitle = "Distance (miles)",
    yTitle = "Delay %",
    symbolStyle = ".",
    symbolColor = "red",
    scales = (list(x = list(draw = FALSE)))
    )
	```

#### Task 3: Visualize delays by the day of the week
1.  Add and run the following code. This code creates the XDF file to be used to plot delays by the day of the week:
	```
    delayDataWithDayXdf <- "FlightDelayWithDay.xdf"
    delayPlotDataWithDayXdf <- rxImport(flightDelayData, outFile = delayDataWithDayXdf,
    overwrite = TRUE, append ="none", rowsPerRead = 1000000,
    varsToKeep = c("Delay", "CRSDepTime", "DayOfWeek"),
    transforms = list(CRSDepTime = cut(as.numeric(CRSDepTime), breaks = 48)),
    rowSelection = (Delay >= 0) & (Delay <= 180)
    )
	```
2. Add and run the following code. This statement refactors the **DayOfWeek** variable in the XDF data:
	```
    delayPlotDataWithDayXdf <- rxFactors(delayPlotDataWithDayXdf, outFile = delayDataWithDayXdf,
    overwrite = TRUE, blocksPerRead = 1,
    factorInfo = list(DayOfWeek = list(newLevels = c(Mon = "1", Tue = "2", Wed = "3", Thu = "4", Fri = "5", Sat = "6", Sun = "7"),
    varName = "DayOfWeek"))
    )
	```
3. Add and run the following code. This statement creates a cube that summarizes the data:
	```
	delayDataWithDayCube <- rxCube(Delay ~ CRSDepTime:DayOfWeek, data = delayPlotDataWithDayXdf)
	```
4. Add and run the following code. This statement creates a data frame from the cube:
	```
	delayPlotDataWithDayDF <- rxResultsDF(delayDataWithDayCube)
	```
5. Add and run the following statement that generates a line plot of delay against the day of the week. Note you may have to move the Plots window to view the graph clearly:
	```
    rxLinePlot(Delay~CRSDepTime|DayOfWeek, data = delayPlotDataWithDayDF, type=c("p", "smooth"),
    lineColor = "blue",
    symbolStyle = ".",
    symbolSize = 2,
    symbolColor = "red",
    title = "Flight delay, by departure day and time",
    xTitle = "Departure time",
    yTitle = "Delay (mins)",
    xNumTicks = 24,
    scales = (list(y = list(labels = c("0", "20", "40", "60", "80", "100", "120", "140", "160", "180")),
    x = list(rot = 90),
    labels = c("Midnight", "", "", "", "02:00", "", "", "", "04:00", "", "", "", "06:00", "", "", "", "08:00", "", "", "", "10:00", "", "", "", "Midday", "", "", "", "14:00", "", "", "", "16:00", "", "", "", "18:00", "", "", "", "20:00", "", "", "", "22:00", "", "", "")))
    )
	```

**Results**: At the end of this exercise, you will have used the **rxLinePlot** function to generate line plots that depict flight delay times as a function of flight time and day of the week.

## Exercise 3: Creating histograms over big data

#### Task 1: Create histograms to visualize the frequencies of different causes of delay
1. Add and run the following code. This code creates the XDF file to be used to plot flight delays by state and by month:
	```
    delayReasonDataXdf <- "FlightDelayReasonData.xdf"
    delayReasonData <- rxImport(flightDelayData, outFile = delayReasonDataXdf,
    overwrite = TRUE, append ="none", rowsPerRead = 1000000,
    varsToKeep = c("OriginState", "Delay", "ArrDelay", "WeatherDelay", "MonthName"),
    rowSelection = (Delay >= 0) & (Delay <= 1000) &
    (ArrDelay >= 0) & (DepDelay >= 0)
    )
	```
2. Add and run the following code. This code creates a histogram that counts the frequency of arrival delays:
	```
    rxHistogram(formula = ~ ArrDelay, data = delayReasonData,
    histType = "Counts", title = "Total Arrival Delays",
    xTitle = "Arrival Delay (minutes)",
    xNumTicks = 10)
	```
3. Add and run the following code. This code creates a histogram that shows the percentage frequency of arrival delays as a percentage:
	```
    rxHistogram(formula = ~ ArrDelay, data = delayReasonData,
    histType = "Percent", title = "Frequency of Arrival Delays",
    xTitle = "Arrival Delay (minutes)",
    xNumTicks = 10)
	```
4. Add and run the following code. This code creates a histogram that shows the percentage frequency of arrival delays as a percentage, organized by state:
	```
    rxHistogram(formula = ~ ArrDelay | OriginState, data = delayReasonData,
    histType = "Percent", title = "Frequency of Arrival Delays by State",
    xTitle = "Arrival Delay (minutes)",
    xNumTicks = 10)
	```
5. Add and run the following code. This code creates a histogram that shows the frequency of weather delays:
	```
    rxHistogram(formula = ~ WeatherDelay, data = delayReasonData,
    histType = "Counts", title = "Frequency of Weather Delays",
    xTitle = "Weather Delay (minutes)",
    xNumTicks = 20, xAxisMinMax = c(0, 180), yAxisMinMax = c(0, 20000))
	```
6. Add and run the following code. This code creates a histogram that shows the frequency of weather delays organized by month:
	```
    rxHistogram(formula = ~ WeatherDelay | MonthName, data = delayReasonData,
    histType = "Counts", title = "Frequency of Weather Delays by Month",
    xTitle = "Weather Delay (minutes)",
    xNumTicks = 10, xAxisMinMax = c(0, 180), yAxisMinMax = c(0, 3000))
	```
7. Save the script as **Lab3Script.R** in the **E:\\Labfiles\\Lab03** folder, and close your R development environment.

**Results**: At the end of this exercise, you will have used the **rxHistogram** function to create histograms that show the relative rates of arrival delay by state, and weather delay by month.
