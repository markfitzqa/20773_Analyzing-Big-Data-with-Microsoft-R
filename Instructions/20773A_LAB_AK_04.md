# Lab: Processing big data

## Exercise 1: Merging the airport and flight delay datasets

#### Task 1: Copy the data to the shared folder
1. Log in to the LON-DEV VM as **Adatum\\AdatumAdmin** with the password **Pa55w.rd**.
2. Open a command prompt window.
3. Run the following commands:
    ```
    net use \\LON-RSVR\Data
    copy E:\Labfiles\Lab04\airportData.xdf \\LON-RSVR\Data
    copy E:\Labfiles\Lab04\FlightDelayData.xdf \\LON-RSVR\\Data
    ```
4. If the **Overwrite** message appears, type **y**, and then press Enter.
5. Verify that both files are copied successfully.

#### Task 2: Refactor the data
1. Start your R development environment of choice (Visual Studio, or RStudio), and create a new R file.
2. Add the following code to the R file and run it. This statement creates a remote R session on the LON-RSVR server:
    ```
	remoteLogin(deployr_endpoint = "http://LON-RSVR.ADATUM.COM:12800", session = TRUE, diff = TRUE, commandline = TRUE, username = "admin", password = "Pa55w.rd")
    ```
3. Add the following code to the R file and run it. This code retrieves the information for the **iata** variable in the **airportData** XDF file and displays it. The code then performs this same operation for the **Origin** and **Dest** variables in the **FlightDelayData** XDF file:
    ```
    airportData = RxXdfData("\\\\LON-RSVR\\Data\\airportData.xdf")
    flightDelayData = RxXdfData("\\\\LON-RSVR\\Data\\flightDelayData.xdf")
    iataFactor <- rxGetVarInfo(airportData, varsToKeep = c("iata"))
    print(iataFactor)
    originFactor <- rxGetVarInfo(flightDelayData, varsToKeep = c("Origin"))
    print(originFactor)
    destFactor <- rxGetVarInfo(flightDelayData, varsToKeep = c("Dest"))
    print(destFactor)
    ```
4. Add the following code to the R file and run it. This code creates a new set of factor levels using the levels in the **iata**, **Origin**, and **Dest** variables:
    ```
    refactorLevels <- unique(c(iataFactor$iata[["levels"]],
    originFactor$Origin[["levels"]],
    destFactor$Dest[["levels"]]))
    ```
5. Add the following code to the R file and run it. This code refactors the **iata** variable in the **airportData** XDF file with the new factor levels:
    ```
    rxOptions(reportProgress = 2)
    refactoredAirportDataFile <- "\\\\LON-RSVR\\Data\\RefactoredAirportData.xdf"
    refactoredAirportData <- rxFactors(inData = airportData, outFile = refactoredAirportDataFile, overwrite = TRUE,
    factorInfo = list(iata = list(newLevels = refactorLevels))
    )
    ```
6. Add the following code to the R file and run it. This code refactors the **Origin** and **Dest** variables in the **FlightDelayData** XDF file with the new factor levels:
    ```
    refactoredFlightDelayDataFile <- "\\\\LON-RSVR\\Data\\RefactoredFlightDelayData.xdf"
    refactoredFlightDelayData <- rxFactors(inData = flightDelayData, outFile = refactoredFlightDelayDataFile, overwrite = TRUE,
    factorInfo = list(Origin = list(newLevels = refactorLevels),
    Dest = list(newLevels = refactorLevels))
    )
    ```
7. Add the following code to the R file and run it. This code displays the new factor levels for the **iata**, **Origin**, and **Dest** variables. They should all be the same now:
    ```
    iataFactor <- rxGetVarInfo(refactoredAirportData, varsToKeep = c("iata"))
    print(iataFactor)
    originFactor <- rxGetVarInfo(refactoredFlightDelayData, varsToKeep = c("Origin"))
    print(originFactor)
    destFactor <- rxGetVarInfo(refactoredFlightDelayData, varsToKeep = c("Dest"))
    print(destFactor)
    ```

#### Task 3: Merge the datasets
1. Add the following code to the R file and run it. This code renames the **iata** field in the refactored airport data file to **Origin**:
    ```
	names(refactoredAirportData)[[1]] <- "Origin"
    ```
2. Add the following code to the R file and run it. This code reblocks the airport data XDF file:
    ```
    reblockedAirportDataFile <- "\\\\LON-RSVR\\Data\\reblockedAirportData.xdf"
    reblockedAirportData <- rxDataStep(refactoredAirportData,
    reblockedAirportDataFile, overwrite = TRUE
    )
    ```
3. Add the following code to the R file and run it. This code uses the **rxMerge** function to merge the two XDF files, performing an inner join over the **Origin** field:
    ```
    mergedFlightDelayDataFile <- "\\\\LON-RSVR\\Data\\MergedFlightDelayData.xdf"
    mergedFlightDelayData <- rxMerge(inData1 = refactoredFlightDelayData, inData2 = reblockedAirportData,
    outFile = mergedFlightDelayDataFile, overwrite = TRUE,
    type = "inner", matchVars = c("Origin"), autoSort = TRUE,
    varsToKeep2 = c("timezone", "Origin"),
    newVarNames2 = c(timezone = "OriginTimeZone"),
    rowsPerOutputBlock = 500000
    )
    ```
4. Add the following code to the R file and run it. This code examines the structure of the new flight delay data file that should now include the **OriginTimeZone** variable, and displays the first and last few rows:
    ```
    rxGetVarInfo(mergedFlightDelayData)
    head(mergedFlightDelayData)
    tail(mergedFlightDelayData)
    ```

**Results**: At the end of this exercise, you will have created a new dataset that combines information from the flight delay data and airport information datasets.

## Exercise 2: Transforming departure and arrival dates to UTC

#### Task 1: Generate a sample of the flight delay data
1. Add the following code to the R file and run it. This code creates a new XDF file containing 0.5% of the data in the flight delay data file (approximately 20,000 rows):
    ```
    rxOptions(reportProgress = 1)
    flightDelayDataSubsetFile <- "\\\\LON-RSVR\\Data\\flightDelayDataSubset.xdf"
    flightDelayDataSubset <- rxDataStep(inData = mergedFlightDelayData,
    outFile = flightDelayDataSubsetFile, overwrite = TRUE,
    rowSelection = rbinom(.rxNumRows, size = 1, prob = 0.005)
    )
    ```
2. Add the following code to the R file and run it. This code displays the metadata for the XDF file containing the sample data:
    ```
	rxGetInfo(flightDelayDataSubset, getBlockSizes = TRUE)
    ```

#### Task 2: Transform the data
1. Add the following code to the R file and run it. This statement installs the **lubridate** package:
    ```
	install.packages("lubridate")
    ```
2. Add the following code to the R file and run it. This code implements the **standardizeTimes** transformation function:
    ```
    standardizeTimes <- function (dataList) {
    # Check to see whether this is a test chunk
    if (.rxIsTestChunk) {
    return(dataList)
    }
    # Create a new vector for holding the standardized departure time
    # and add it to the list of variable values
    departureTimeVarIndex <- length(dataList) + 1
    dataList[[departureTimeVarIndex]] <- rep(as.numeric(NA), times = .rxNumRows)
    names(dataList)[departureTimeVarIndex] <- "StandardizedDepartureTime"
    # Do the same for standardized arrival time
    arrivalTimeVarIndex <- length(dataList) + 1
    dataList[[arrivalTimeVarIndex]] <- rep(as.numeric(NA), times = .rxNumRows)
    names(dataList)[arrivalTimeVarIndex] <- "StandardizedArrivalTime"
    departureYearVarIndex <- 1
    departureMonthVarIndex <- 2
    departureDayVarIndex <- 3
    departureTimeStringVarIndex <- 4
    elapsedTimeVarIndex <- 5
    departureTimezoneVarIndex <- 6
    # Iterate through the rows and add the standardized arrival and departure times
    for (i in 1:.rxNumRows) {
    # Get the local departure time details
    departureYear <- dataList[[departureYearVarIndex]][i]
    departureMonth <- dataList[[departureMonthVarIndex]][i]
    departureDay <- dataList[[departureDayVarIndex]][i]
    departureHour <- trunc(as.numeric(dataList[[departureTimeStringVarIndex]][i]) / 100)
    departureMinute <- as.numeric(dataList[[departureTimeStringVarIndex]][i]) %% 100
    departureTimeZone <- dataList[[departureTimezoneVarIndex]][i]
    # Construct the departure date and time, including timezone
    departureDateTimeString <- paste(departureYear, "-", departureMonth, "-", departureDay, " ", departureHour, ":", departureMinute, sep="")
    departureDateTime <- as.POSIXct(departureDateTimeString, tz = departureTimeZone)
    # Convert to UTC and store it
    standardizedDepartureDateTime <- format(departureDateTime, tz="UTC")
    dataList[[departureTimeVarIndex]][i] <- standardizedDepartureDateTime
    # Calculate the arrival date and time
    # Do this by adding the elapsed time to the departure time
    # The elapsed time is stored as the number of minutes (an integer)
    elapsedTime = dataList[[5]][i]
    standardizedArrivalDateTime <- format(as.POSIXct(standardizedDepartureDateTime) + minutes(elapsedTime))
    # Store it
    dataList[[arrivalTimeVarIndex]][i] <- standardizedArrivalDateTime
    }
    # Return the data including the new variables
    return(dataList)
    }
    ```
3. Add the following code to the R file and run it. This code uses the **rxDataStep** function to perform the transformation:
    ```
    flightDelayDataTimeZonesFile <- "\\\\LON-RSVR\\Data\\flightDelayDataTimezones.xdf"
    flightDelayDataTimeZones <- rxDataStep(inData = flightDelayDataSubset,
    outFile = flightDelayDataTimeZonesFile, overwrite = TRUE,
    transformFunc = standardizeTimes,
    transformVars = c("Year", "Month", "DayofMonth", "DepTime", "ActualElapsedTime", "OriginTimeZone"),
    transformPackages = c("lubridate")
    )
    ```
4. Add the following code to the R file and run it. This code examines the transformed data file:
    ```
    rxGetVarInfo(flightDelayDataTimeZones)
    head(flightDelayDataTimeZones)
    tail(flightDelayDataTimeZones)
    ```

**Results**: At the end of this exercise, you will have implemented a transformation function that adds variables containing the standardized departure and arrival times to the flight delay dataset.

## Exercise 3: Calculating cumulative average delays for each route

#### Task 1: Sort the data
1. Add the following code to the R file and run it. This code sorts the flight delay data by departure date:
    ```
    sortedFlightDelayDataFile <- "sortedFlightDelayData.xdf"
    sortedFlightDelayData <- rxSort(inData = flightDelayDataTimeZones,
    outFile = sortedFlightDelayDataFile, overwrite = TRUE,
    sortByVars = c("StandardizedDepartureTime")
    )
    ```
2. Add the following code to the R file and run it. This code displays the first and last few lines of the sorted file. Examine the data in the **StandardizedDepartureTime** variable:
    ```
	head(sortedFlightDelayData)
	tail(sortedFlightDelayData)
    ```

#### Task 2: Calculate the cumulative average delays
1. Add the following code to the R file and run it. This code implements the **calculateCumulativeAverageDelays** transformation function:
    ```
    calculateCumulativeAverageDelays <- function (dataList) {
    # Check to see whether this is a test chunk
    if (.rxIsTestChunk) {
    return(dataList)
    }
    # Add a new vector for holding the cumulative average delay
    # and add it to the list of variable values
    cumulativeAverageDelayVarIndex <- length(dataList) + 1
    dataList[[cumulativeAverageDelayVarIndex]] <- rep(as.numeric(NA), times = .rxNumRows)
    names(dataList)[cumulativeAverageDelayVarIndex] <- "CumulativeAverageDelayForRoute"
    originVarIndex <- 1
    destVarIndex <- 2
    delayVarIndex <- 3
    # Retrieve the vector containing the cumulative delays recorded so far for each route
    cumulativeDelays <- .rxGet("cumulativeDelays")
    # Retrieve the vecor containing the number of times each route has occurred so far
    cumulativeRouteOccurrences <- .rxGet("cumulativeRouteOccurrences")
    # Iterate through the rows and add the standardized arrival and departure times
    for (i in 1:.rxNumRows) {
    # Get the route and delay details
    origin <- dataList[[originVarIndex]][i]
    dest <- dataList[[destVarIndex]][i]
    routeDelay <- dataList[[delayVarIndex]][i]
    # Create a string that identifies the route
    route <- paste(origin, dest, sep = "")
    # Retrieve the current cumulative delay and number of occurrences for each route
    delay <- cumulativeDelays[[route]]
    occurrences <- cumulativeRouteOccurrences[[route]]
    # Update the cumulative statistics
    delay <- ifelse(is.null(delay), 0, delay) + routeDelay
    occurrences <- ifelse(is.null(occurrences), 0, occurrences) + 1
    # Work out the new running average delay for the route
    cumulativeAverageDelay <- delay / occurrences
    # Store the data and updated stats
    dataList[[cumulativeAverageDelayVarIndex]][i] <- cumulativeAverageDelay
    cumulativeDelays[[route]] <- delay
    cumulativeRouteOccurrences[[route]] <- occurrences
    }
    # Save the lists containing the cumulative data so far
    .rxSet("cumulativeDelays", cumulativeDelays)
    .rxSet("cumulativeRouteOccurrences", cumulativeRouteOccurrences)
    # Return the data including the new variable
    return(dataList)
    }
    ```
2. Add the following code to the R file and run it. This code uses **rxDataStep** to run the **calculateCumulativeAverageDelays** transformation function:
    ```
    flightDelayDataWithAveragesFile <- "\\\\LON-RSVR\\Data\\flightDelayDataWithAverages.xdf"
    flightDelayDataWithAverages <- rxDataStep(inData = sortedFlightDelayData,
    outFile = flightDelayDataWithAveragesFile, overwrite = TRUE,
    transformFunc = calculateCumulativeAverageDelays,
    transformVars = c("Origin", "Dest", "Delay"),
    transformObjects = list(cumulativeDelays = list(), cumulativeRouteOccurrences = list())
    )
    ```

#### Task 3: Verify the results
1. Add the following code to the R file and run it. This code examines the transformed data file:
    ```
    rxGetVarInfo(flightDelayDataWithAverages)
    head(flightDelayDataWithAverages)
    tail(flightDelayDataWithAverages)
    ```
2. Add the following code to the R file and run it. This creates a scatter and regression plot showing the cumulative average delay for flights from ATL to PHX (Atlanta to Phoenix):
    ```
    rxLinePlot(CumulativeAverageDelayForRoute ~ as.POSIXct(StandardizedDepartureTime), type = c("p", "r"),
    flightDelayDataWithAverages,
    rowSelection = (Origin == "ATL") & (Dest == "PHX"),
    yTitle = "Cumulative Average Delay for Route",
    xTitle = "Date"
    )
    ```
3. Repeat step 2 and replace the **rowSelection** argument with each of the following values in turn:
-   . rowSelection = (Origin == "SFO") & (Dest == "LAX")
-   . rowSelection = (Origin == "LAX") & (Dest == "SFO")
-   . rowSelection = (Origin == "DEN") & (Dest == "SLC")
-   . rowSelection = (Origin == "LGA") & (Dest == "ORD")
4. Save the script as **Lab4Script.R** in the **E:\\Labfiles\\Lab04** folder, and close your R development environment.

**Results**: At the end of this exercise, you will have sorted data, and created and tested another transformation function.
