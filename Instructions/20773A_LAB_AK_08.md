# Module 8: Processing Big Data in SQL Server and Hadoop
# Lab A: Deploying a predictive model to SQL Server

## Exercise 1: Upload the flight delay data

#### Task 1: Configure SQL Server and create the FlightDelays database
01.  Log on to the **LON-DEV** VM as **Adatum\\AdatumAdmin** with the password **Pa55w.rd**.
02.  On the Windows desktop, click **Start**, type **Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio**, and then press Enter.
03.  In the **Connect to Server** dialog box, log on to **LON-SQLR** using Windows authentication.
04.  In the toolbar, click **New Query**.
05.  In the **Query** window, type the following commands. These commands enable you to run the **sp\_execute\_external\_script** stored procedure:
    ```
    sp_configure 'external scripts enabled', 1;
    RECONFIGURE;
    ```
06.  In the toolbar, click **Execute**.
07.  In **Object Explorer**, right-click **LON-SQLR**, and then click **Restart**.
08.  In the **Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio** message box, click **Yes**.
09.  In the second **Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio** message box, click **Yes**.
10.  Wait for SQL Server to restart.
11.  In **Object Explorer**, expand **LON-SQLR**, right-click **Databases**, and then click **New Database**.
12.  In the **New Database** dialog box, in the **Database name** text box, type **FlightDelays**, and then click **OK**.
13.  Leave SQL Server Management Studio open.

#### Task 2: Upload the flight delay data to SQL Server
1.  Open a command prompt window.
2.  Run the following commands:
    ```
    net use \\LON-RSVR\Data
    copy E:\Labfiles\Lab08\FlightDelayDataSample.xdf \\LON-RSVR\Data
    ```
3.  Verify that the file is copied successfully, and then close the command prompt.
4.  Start your R development environment of choice (Visual Studio, or RStudio), and create a new R file.
5.  In the script editor, add the following statement to the R file and run it. This code ensures that you are running in the local compute context:
    ```
    rxSetComputeContext(RxLocalSeq())
    ```
6.  In the script editor, add the following statement to the R file and run it. This code creates a connection string for the SQL Server **FlightDelays** database, and an **RxSqlServerData** data source for the **flightdelaydata** table in the database:
    ```
    connStr <- "Driver=SQL Server;Server=LON-SQLR;Database=FlightDelays;Trusted_Connection=Yes"
    flightDelayDataTable <- RxSqlServerData(connectionString = connStr,
	table = "flightdelaydata")
    ```
7.  Add the following code to the R file and run it. These statements import the data from the **FlightDelayDataSample**.xdf file and adds the **DelayedByWeather** logical factor and **Dataset** column to each observation:
    ```
    rxOptions("reportProgress" = 2)
    flightDelayDataFile <- "\\\\LON-RSVR\\Data\\FlightDelayDataSample.xdf"
    flightDelayData <- rxDataStep(inData = flightDelayDataFile,
    outFile = flightDelayDataTable, overwrite = TRUE,
    transforms = list(DelayedByWeather = factor(ifelse(is.na(WeatherDelay), 0, WeatherDelay) > 0, levels = c(FALSE, TRUE)),
    Dataset = factor(ifelse(runif(.rxNumRows) >= 0.05, "train", "test")))
    )
    ```

#### Task 3: Examine the data in the database
1.  Add the following statements to the R file and run it. This code creates a new SQL Server compute context:
    ```
    sqlWait <- TRUE
    sqlConsoleOutput <- TRUE
    sqlContext <- RxInSqlServer(connectionString = connStr,
    wait = sqlWait, consoleOutput = sqlConsoleOutput
    )
    rxSetComputeContext(sqlContext)
    ```
2.  Add the following code to the R file and run it. These statements create an **RxSqlServerData** data source that reads the flight delay data from the SQL Server database and refactors it:
    ```
    weatherDelayQuery = "SELECT Month, MonthName, OriginState, DestState,
    Dataset, DelayedByWeather, WeatherDelayCategory = CASE
    WHEN CEILING(WeatherDelay) <= 0 THEN 'No delay'
    WHEN CEILING(WeatherDelay) BETWEEN 1 AND 30 THEN '1-30 minutes'
    WHEN CEILING(WeatherDelay) BETWEEN 31 AND 60 THEN '31-60 minutes'
    WHEN CEILING(WeatherDelay) BETWEEN 61 AND 120 THEN '61-120 minutes'
    WHEN CEILING(WeatherDelay) BETWEEN 121 AND 180 THEN '121-180 minutes'
    WHEN CEILING(WeatherDelay) >= 181 THEN 'More than 180 minutes'
    END
    FROM flightdelaydata"
    delayDataSource <- RxSqlServerData(sqlQuery = weatherDelayQuery,
    colClasses = c(
    Month = "factor",
    OriginState = "factor",
    DestState = "factor",
    Dataset = "character",
    DelayedByWeather = "factor",
    WeatherDelayCategory = "factor"
    ),
    colInfo = list(
    MonthName = list(
    type = "factor",
    levels = month.name
    )
    ),
    connectionString = connStr
    )
    ```
3.  Add the following statement to the R file and run it. This statement retrieves the details for each variable in the data source:
    ```
	rxGetVarInfo(delayDataSource)
    ```
There should be seven variables, named **Month**, **MonthName**, **OriginState**, **DestState**, **Dataset**, **DelayedByWeather**, and **WeatherDelayCategory**.
4.  Add the following statement to the R file and run it. This statement retrieves the data from the data source and summarizes it:
    ```
	rxSummary(~., delayDataSource)
    ```
5.  Add the following code to the R file and run it. This statement creates a histogram that shows the categorized delays by month:
    ```
    rxHistogram(~WeatherDelayCategory | MonthName,
    data = delayDataSource,
    xTitle = "Weather Delay",
    scales = (list(
    x = list(rot = 90)
    ))
    )
    ```
6.  Add the following code to the R file and run it. This statement creates a histogram that shows the categorized delays by origin state:
    ```
    rxHistogram(~WeatherDelayCategory | OriginState,
    data = delayDataSource,
    xTitle = "Weather Delay",
    scales = (list(
    x = list(rot = 90, cex = 0.5)
    ))
    )
    ```

	**Results**: At the end of this exercise, you will have imported the flight delay data to SQL Server and used ScaleR functions to examine this data.

## Exercise 2: Fit a DForest model to the weather delay data

#### Task 1: Create a DForest model
1.  Add the following code to the R file and run it. This statement fits a DTree model to the weather delay data:
    ```
    weatherDelayModel <- rxDForest(DelayedByWeather ~ Month + OriginState + DestState,
    data = delayDataSource,
    cp = 0.0001,
    rowSelection = (Dataset == "train")
    )
    ```
2.  Add the following statement to the R file and run it. This statement summarizes the forecast accuracy of the model:
    ```
	print(weatherDelayModel)
    ```
3.  Add the following statement to the R file and run it. This statement shows the structure of the decision trees in the DForest model:
    ```
	head(weatherDelayModel)
    ```
4.  Add the following statement to the R file and run it. This statement shows the relative importance of each predictor variable to the decisions made by the model:
    ```
	rxVarUsed (weatherDelayModel)
    ```

#### Task 2: Score the DForest model
1.  Add the following code to the R file and run it. This statement modifies the query used by the data source and adds a WHERE clause to limit the rows retrieved to the test data:
    ```
	delayDataSource@sqlQuery <- paste(delayDataSource@sqlQuery, "WHERE Dataset = 'test'", sep = " ")
    ```
2.  Add the following code to the R file and run it. This statement creates a data source that will be used to store scored results in the database:
    ```
	weatherDelayScoredResults <- RxSqlServerData(connectionString = connStr,
	table = "scoredresults")
    ```
3.  Add the following code to the R file and run it. These statements switch to the local compute context, generate weather delay predictions using the new data set and save the scored results in the **scoredresults** table in the database, and then return to the SQL Server compute context:
    ```
    rxSetComputeContext(RxLocalSeq())
    rxPredict(modelObj = weatherDelayModel,
    data = delayDataSource,
    outData = weatherDelayScoredResults, overwrite = TRUE,
    writeModelVars = TRUE,
    predVarNames = c("PredictedDelay", "PredictedNoDelay", "PredictedDelayedByWeather"),
    type = "prob")
    rxSetComputeContext(sqlContext)
    ```
4.  Add the following code to the R file and run it. This code tests the scored results against the real data and plots the accuracy of the predictions:
    ```
    install.packages('ROCR')
    library(ROCR)
    # Transform the prediction data into a standardized form
    results <- rxImport(weatherDelayScoredResults)
    weatherDelayPredictions <- prediction(results$PredictedDelay, results$DelayedByWeather)
    # Plot the ROC curve of the predictions
    rocCurve <- performance(weatherDelayPredictions, measure = "tpr", x.measure = "fpr")
    plot(rocCurve)
    ```
5.  If the **Microsoft Visual Studio** dialog boxes appear, click **Yes**.

**Results**: At the end of this exercise, you will have created a decision tree forest using the weather data held in the SQL Server database, scored it, and stored the results back in the database.

## Exercise 3: Store the model in SQL Server

#### Task 1: Save the model to the database
1.  Add the following code to the R file and run it. These statements created a serialized representation of the model as a string of binary data:
    ```
	serializedModel <- serialize(weatherDelayModel, NULL)
	serializedModelString <- paste(serializedModel, collapse = "")
    ```
2.  Return to SQL Server Management Studio.

3.  In the toolbar, click **New Query**. In the Query window, type the following code:
    ```
    USE FlightDelays;
    CREATE TABLE [dbo].[delaymodels]
    (
    modelId INT IDENTITY(1,1) NOT NULL Primary KEY,
    model VARBINARY(MAX) NOT NULL
    );
    ```
4.  In the toolbar, click **Execute**. Verify that the code runs without any errors.
5.  Overwrite the code in the **Query** window with the following block of Transact-SQL:
    ```
    CREATE PROCEDURE [dbo].[PersistModel] @m NVARCHAR(MAX)
    AS
    BEGIN
    SET NOCOUNT ON;
    INSERT INTO delaymodels(model) VALUES (CONVERT(VARBINARY(MAX),@m,2))
    END;
    ```
6.  In the toolbar, click **Execute**. Verify that the code runs without any errors.
7.  Return to your R development environment.
8.  Add the following statements to the R file and run it. This code uses an ODBC connection to run the **PersistModel** stored procedure and save your DTree model to the database:
    ```
    install.packages('RODBC')
    library(RODBC)
    connection <- odbcDriverConnect(connStr)
    cmd <- paste("EXEC PersistModel @m='", serializedModelString, "'", sep = "")
    sqlQuery(connection, cmd)
    ```

#### Task 2: Create a stored procedure that runs the model to make predictions
1.  Switch back to SQL Server Management Studio.
2.  Overwrite the code in the **Query** window with the following block of Transact-SQL:
    ```
    CREATE PROCEDURE [dbo].[PredictWeatherDelay]
    @Month integer = 1,
    @OriginState char(2),
    @DestState char(2)
    AS
    BEGIN
    DECLARE @weatherDelayModel varbinary(max) = (SELECT TOP 1 model FROM dbo.delaymodels)
    EXEC sp_execute_external_script @language = N'R',
    @script = N'
    delayParams <- data.frame(Month = month, OriginState = originState, DestState = destState)
    delayModel <- unserialize(as.raw(model))
    OutputDataSet<-rxPredict(modelObject = delayModel,
    data = delayParams,
    outData = NULL,
    predVarNames = c("PredictedDelay", "PredictedNoDelay", "PredictedDelayedByWeather"),
    type = "prob",
    writeModelVars = TRUE)',
    @params = N'@model varbinary(max),
    @month integer,
    @originState char(2),
    @destState char(2)',
    @model = @weatherDelayModel,
    @month = @Month,
    @originState = @OriginState,
    @destState = @DestState
    WITH RESULT SETS (([PredictedDelay] float, [PredictedNoDelay] float, [PredictedDelayedByWeather] bit, [Month] integer, [OriginState] char(2), [DestState] char(2)));
    END
    ```
3.  In the toolbar, click **Execute**. Verify that the code runs without any errors.
4.  Return to your R development environment.
5.  Add the following statements to the R file and run it. This code tests the stored procedure:
    ```
    cmd <- "EXEC [dbo].[PredictWeatherDelay] @Month = 10, @OriginState = 'MI', @DestState = 'NY'"
    sqlQuery(connection, cmd)
    ```
6.  Save the script as **Lab8\_1Script.R** in the **E:\\Labfiles\\Lab08** folder, and close your R development environment.
7.  Close SQL Server Management Studio, without saving any changes.

**Results**: At the end of this exercise, you will have saved the DForest model to SQL Server, and created a stored procedure that you can use to make weather delay predictions using this model.

# Lab B: Incorporating Hadoop Map/Reduce and Spark functionality into the ScaleR workflow

## Exercise 1: Using Pig with ScaleR functions

#### Task 1: Examine the Pig script
1.  Log on to the **LON-DEV** VM as **Adatum\\AdatumAdmin** with the password **Pa55w.rd**.
2.  Using **WordPad**, open the file **carrierDelays.pig** in the **E:\\Labfiles\\Lab08** folder.
3.  Review the script.
4.  Edit the first line of the script, and change the text **{specify login name}** to your login name, as shown in the following example:
    ```
	%declare loginName 'student01'
    ```
5.  Save the file and close Wordpad.

#### Task 2: Upload the Pig script and flight delay data to HDFS
1.  Start your R development environment of choice (Visual Studio, or RStudio), and create a new R file.
2.  In the script editor, add the following statements to the R file and run them. Change **student*nn*** to your login name, and then and run the code. These statements establish a new **RxHadoopMR** compute context:
    ```
    loginName = "studentnn"
    context <- RxHadoopMR(sshUsername = loginName,
    sshHostname = "LON-HADOOP",
    consoleOutput = TRUE)
    rxSetComputeContext(context, wait = TRUE)
    ```
3.  Add the following statements to the R file and run them. This code removes the **FlightDelayDataSample.csv** file from your directory in HDFS (if it exists; you can ignore the error message if it is not found), and copies the latest data from the E:\\Labfiles\\Lab08 folder:
    ```
    rxHadoopRemove(path = paste("/user/RevoShare/", loginName, "/FlightDelayDataSample.csv", sep="") )
    rxHadoopCopyFromClient(source = "E:\\Labfiles\\Lab08\\FlightDelayDataSample.csv",
    hdfsDest = paste("/user/RevoShare/", loginName, sep=""))
    ```
4.  Add the following statements to the R file and run them. This code uploads the **carriers.csv** file to your directory in HDFS:
    ```
    rxHadoopRemove(path = paste("/user/RevoShare/", loginName, "/carriers.csv", sep=""))
    rxHadoopCopyFromClient(source = "E:\\Labfiles\\Lab08\\carriers.csv",
    hdfsDest = paste("/user/RevoShare/", loginName, sep=""))
    ```
5.  Add the following statements to the R file and run them. Replace the text ***fqdn*** with the URL of the Hadoop VM in Azure (for example, LON-HADOOP-01.ukwest.cloudapp.azure.com). This code closes the **RxHadoopMR** compute context, creates a remote R session on the Hadoop VM, and loads the **RevoScaleR** library in that session:
    ```
	rxSetComputeContext(RxLocalSeq())
	remoteLogin(deployr_endpoint = "http://fqdn:12800", session = TRUE, diff = TRUE, commandline = TRUE, username = "admin", password = "Pa55w.rd")
	library(RevoScaleR)
    ```
6.  Add the following statements to the R file and run them. This code copies the Pig script (and the **loginName** variable) to the remote session:
    ```
    pause()
    putLocalFile("E:\\Labfiles\\Lab08\\carrierDelays.pig")
    putLocalObject(c("loginName"))
    resume()
    ```

#### Task 3: Run the Pig script and examine the results
1.  Add the following statement to the R file and run it. This code runs the Pig script:
    ```
	result <- system("pig carrierDelays.pig", intern = TRUE)
    ```
2.  Add the following code to the R file and run it. This code lists the contents of the /user/RevoShare/*studentnn* directory in HDFS. This directory should include a subdirectory named **results**:
    ```
	rxHadoopCommand(paste("fs -ls -R /user/RevoShare/", loginName, sep = ""), intern = TRUE)
    ```
3.  Verify that the results directory contains two files: **\_SUCCESS** and **part-r-00000**. The data is actually in the part-r-00000 file.
4.  Add the following statement to the R file and run it. This code deletes the **\_SUCCESS** file from the **results** directory:
    ```
	rxHadoopRemove(paste("fs -ls -R /user/RevoShare/", loginName, "/results/_SUCCESS", sep = ""))
    ```
5.  Add the following statements to the R file and run them. These statements display the structure of the results generated by the Pig script:
    ```
    rxOptions(reportProgress = 1)
    rxSetFileSystem(RxHdfsFileSystem())
    resultsFile <- paste("/user/RevoShare/", loginName, "/results", sep = "")
    resultsData <- RxTextData(resultsFile)
    rxGetVarInfo(resultsData)
    ```

#### Task 4: Convert the results to XDF format and add field names
1.  Add the following code to the R file and run it:
    ```
    carrierDelayColInfo <- list(V1 = list(type = "factor", newName = "Origin"),
    V2 = list(type = "factor", newName = "Dest"),
    V3 = list(type = "factor", newName = "AirlineCode"),
    V4 = list(type = "character", newName = "AirlineName"),
    V5 = list(type = "numeric", newName = "CarrierDelay"),
    V6 = list(type = "numeric", newName = "LateAircraftDelay")
    )
    ```
2.  Add the following code to the R file and run it. This code creates the **CarrierData** composite XDF file in HDFS:
    ```
    carrierFile <- RxXdfData(paste("/user/RevoShare", loginName, "CarrierData", sep = "/"))
    carrierData <- rxImport(inData = resultsData,
    outFile = carrierFile, overwrite = TRUE,
    colInfo = carrierDelayColInfo,
    createCompositeSet = TRUE)
    ```
3.  Add the following code to the R file and run it. This code creates a new **RxHadoopMR** compute context in the remote session:
    ```
	hadoopContext = RxHadoopMR(sshUsername = loginName, consoleOutput = TRUE)
	rxSetComputeContext(hadoopContext)
    ```
4.  Add the following code to the R file and run it. This code displays the structure of the XDF file which should now include the new mappings:
    ```
	rxGetVarInfo(carrierData)
    ```
5.  Add the following code to the R file and run it. This code summarizes the contents of the XDF file:
    ```
	rxSummary(~., carrierData)
    ```
Note that this function runs as a Map/Reduce job

#### Task 5: Create graphs to visualize the airline delay data
1.  Add the following code to the R file and run it. This code creates a data frame that contains the airline delay information (carrier delay plus late aircraft delay), and then uses this data frame to generate a histogram of delay times:
    ```
    transformedCarrierData <- rxDataStep(carrierData, transforms = list(TotalDelay = CarrierDelay + LateAircraftDelay))
    # The data source for this histogram is an in-memory data frame, so the processing is not distributed
    rxHistogram(~TotalDelay, data = transformedCarrierData,
    xTitle = "Carrier + Late Aircraft Delay (minutes)",
    yTitle = "Occurrences",
    endVal = 300
    )
    ```
2.  Add the following code to the R file and run it. This code changes the resolution of the plot window to 1024 by 768 pixels, and then generates a histogram showing the number of delayed flights for each airline:
    ```
    png(width=1024, height=768);rxHistogram(~AirlineCode, data = carrierData,
    xTitle = "Airline",
    yTitle = "Number of delayed flights"
    );dev.off()
    ```
3.  Add the following code to the R file and run it. This code creates a bar chart showing the total delay time for all flights made by each airline:
    ```
    library(ggplot2)
    ggplot(data = rxImport(carrierData, transforms = list(TotalDelay = CarrierDelay + LateAircraftDelay))) +
    geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = AirlineName, y = TotalDelay), stat = "identity") +
    labs(x = "Airline", y = "Total Carrier + Late Aircraft Delay (minutes)") +
    scale_x_discrete(labels = function(x) { lapply(strwrap(x, width = 25, simplify = FALSE), paste, collapse = "\n")}) +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, size = 8))
    ```

#### Task 6: Investigate the mean airline delay by route
1.  Add the following code to the R script and run it. This code creates a data cube that calculates the mean delay for each airline by route:
    ```
    delayData <- rxCube(AverageDelay ~ AirlineCode:Origin:Dest, carrierData,
    transforms = list(AverageDelay = CarrierDelay + LateAircraftDelay),
    means = TRUE,
    na.rm = TRUE, removeZeroCounts = TRUE)
    ```
2.  Add the following code to the R script and run it. This code uses the **rxExec** function to run **rxSort** to sort the data in the cube:
    ```
	sortedDelayData <- rxExec(FUN=rxSort, as.data.frame(delayData), sortByVars = c("Counts", "AverageDelay"), decreasing = c(TRUE, TRUE), timesToRun = 1)
    ```
3.  Add the following code to the R script and run it. This the top 50 rows in the sorted cube (the routes with the most frequent and longest delays).
    ```
	head(sortedDelayData$rxElem1, 50)
    ```
4.  Add the following code to the R script and run it. This code shows the bottom 50 rows in the sorted cube (the routes with the least frequent and shortest delays):
    ```
	tail(sortedDelayData$rxElem1, 50)
    ```
5.  Add the following code to the R script and run it. This code switches to the local compute context and saves the data cube to the file SortedDelayData.csv in HDFS:
    ```
    rxSetComputeContext(RxLocalSeq())
    sortedDelayDataFile <- paste("/user/RevoShare/", loginName, "/SortedDelayData.csv", sep = "")
    sortedDelayDataCsv <- RxTextData(sortedDelayDataFile)
    sortedDelayDataSet <- rxDataStep(inData = sortedDelayData$rxElem1,
    outFile = sortedDelayDataCsv, overwrite = TRUE
    )
    ```

**Results**: At the end of this exercise, you will have run a Pig script from R, and analyzed the data that the script produces.

## Exercise 2: Integrating ScaleR code with Spark and Hive

#### Task 1: Upload the sorted delay data to Hive
1.  Add the following code to the R script and run it. This code creates an **RxSpark** compute context:
    ```
    sparkContext = RxSpark(sshUsername = loginName,
    consoleOutput = TRUE,
    numExecutors = 10,
    executorCores = 2,
    executorMem = "1g",
    driverMem = "1g")
    rxSetComputeContext(sparkContext)
    ```
2.  Add the following code to the R script and run it. This code creates an **RxHiveData** data source:
    ```
	dbTable <- paste(loginName, "RouteDelays", sep = "")
	hiveDataSource <- RxHiveData(table = dbTable)
    ```
3.  Add the following code to the R script and run it. This code uploads the data to Hive:
    ```
	data <- rxDataStep(inData = sortedDelayDataSet,
	outFile = hiveDataSource, overwrite = TRUE)
    ```
4.  Add the following code to the R script and run it. This code runs the **rxSummary** function over the Hive data:
    ```
	rxSummary(~., hiveDataSource)
    ```

#### Task 2: Use Hive to perform ad-hoc queries over the data
1.  Open a command prompt window, and run the **putty** command.
2.  In the **PuTTY Configuration** window, select the **LON-HADOOP** session, click **Load**, and then click **Open**. You should be logged in to the Hadoop VM.
3.  In the PuTTY terminal window, run the following command:
    ```
	hive
    ```
4.  At the **hive\>** prompt, run the following command:
    ```
	select * from *studentnn*routedelays;
    ```
Replace *studentnn* with your login name.
Verify that 8852 rows are retrieved.
5.  At the **hive\>** prompt, run the following command:
    ```
	select count(*), airlinecode from *studentnn*routedelays group by airlinecode;
    ```
Replace *studentnn* with your login name.
This command lists each airline together with the number of delayed flights for that airline.
6.  At the **hive\>** prompt, run the following command to exit hive:
    ```
	exit;
    ```
7.  Close the PuTTY terminal window, and return to your R development environment.

#### Task 3: Use a sparklyr session to analyze data
1.  Add the following code to the R script and run it. This code loads the **sparklyr** and **dplyr** libraries.
    ```
	library(sparklyr)
	library(dplyr)
    ```
2.  Add the following code to the R script and run it. This code closes the current **RxSpark** compute context and creates a new one that supports sparklyr interop:
    ```
    rxSparkDisconnect(sparkContext)
    connection = rxSparkConnect(sshUsername = loginName,
    consoleOutput = TRUE,
    numExecutors = 10,
    executorCores = 2,
    executorMem = "1g",
    driverMem = "1g",
    interop = "sparklyr")
    ```
3.  Add the following code to the R script and run it. This code creates a new sparklyr session:
    ```
	sparklyrSession <- rxGetSparklyrConnection(connection)
    ```
4.  Add the following code to the R script and run it. This code lists the tables available in Hive:
    ```
	src_tbls(sparklyrSession)
    ```
5.  Add the following code to the R script and run it. This code caches your **routedelays** table and fetches the data in this table:
    ```
	tbl_cache(sparklyrSession, dbTable)
	routeDelaysTable <- tbl(sparklyrSession, dbTable)
	head(routeDelaysTable)
    ```
6.  Add the following code to the R script and run it. This code constructs a **dplyr** pipeline that finds the delays for all flights for American Airlines that departed from New York JFK, and saves the results in a tibble:
    ```
    routeDelaysTable %>%
    filter(AirlineCode == "AA" & Origin == "JFK") %>%
    select(Dest, AverageDelay) %>%
    collect ->
    aajfkData
    ```
7.  Add the following code to the R script and run it. This code displays the data in the tibble and summarizes it:
    ```
	print(aajfkData)
	rxSummary(~., aajfkData)
    ```
8.  Add the following code to the R script and run it. This code closes the sparklyr session and disconnects from the RxSpark compute context:
    ```
	rxSparkDisconnect(connection)
    ```
9.  Save the script as **Lab8\_2Script.R** in the **E:\\Labfiles\\Lab08** folder, and close your R development environment.

**Results**: At the end of this exercise, you will have used R code running in an RxSpark compute context to upload data to Hive, and then analyzed the data by using a sparklyr session running in the RxSpark compute context.
